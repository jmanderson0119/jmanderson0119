## Repositories

I am currently making frequent contributions to this game design project I cooked up last spring that I wanted to see come to life, [here](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/atlas-cosmic-courier). However, I am always available to contact at [jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu) regarding new projects to contribute to! Here is what's currently available to take a look at on my account:
