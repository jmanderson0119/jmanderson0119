# About Me

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Jacob Anderson and this account is a collection of projects I have completed at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). 

## Background

I am a current undergraduate under a combined program and I plan to pursue a doctorate following my five-year program. My research interests include attention methods in computer vision, noise robustness in learning algorithms, and algebraic/novel learning methodology. 

## Repositories

I am currently available to contact at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)** regarding new projects to collaborate on! Here some of what's available to look at on my account:

- **[autonomous-vehicle-image-restoration](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/autonomous-vehicle-image-restoration)** A research project carried out with [Aniyah Shirehjini, CWRU](https://github.com/aniyahs); a pipeline to restore distorted vehicle imaging in bad weather conditions.
- **[atlas-cosmic-courier:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/atlas-cosmic-courier)** A little practice project in programming smooth flight mechanics in Unity; learned a lot about quaternions :)
- **[cymko:](https://cwru-ecse390.itch.io/cymko-f2024-team-2)** An action-platformer made in collaboration with students from Case Western and the Cleveland Institute of Art, where I designed and led the implementation of the reactive agent infrastructure underlying each of the game bosses. 
- **[language-interpreter:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/language-interpreter)** An interpreter for a very simple Java/C-reminiscent syntax, containing basic semantic actions such as assignment, math operations, conditionals, etc.
- **[sliding-tile-search-agent:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/first-ai-project)** This is my first hands-on experience in programming an intelligent agent, it's a simple bot written in Julia to solve the [8-puzzle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/8-puzzle-problem-using-branch-and-bound/) using Best-First and Local Beam search strategies.


## Contact

Email is my preferred method of contact (at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)**), however my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-anderson-ml/) is also a reliable way to make sure I see your correspondence.
