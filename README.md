# About Me

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Jacob Anderson and this account is a collection of projects I have completed at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). 

## Background

I am a current undergraduate under a combined master's program and I plan to pursue a doctorate at some point following my five-year program. My research interests include attention methods in computer vision, noise robustness in learning algorithms, and algebraic/novel learning methodology. 

## Repositories

I am currently available to contact at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)** regarding new projects to collaborate on! Here some of what's available to look at on my account:

- **[crowding-prediction](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/crowding-prediction)** A novel approach of measuring crowding of momentum strategies in the stock market, using Siamese networks to learn an effective embedding space of time series return data. This project underlies the thesis requisite of my graduate degree.
- **[ufc-scraper](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/ufc-scraper)** A web scraper implementation in Julia designed for collecting match outcome stats from the UFCStats platform; for my purposes, it is a dataset curator for my study in probabilistic graphical models.
- **[autonomous-vehicle-image-restoration](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/autonomous-vehicle-image-restoration)** A research project carried out with [Aniyah Shirehjini, CWRU](https://github.com/aniyahs); a pipeline to restore distorted vehicle imaging in bad weather conditions.
- **[atlas-cosmic-courier:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/atlas-cosmic-courier)** A little practice project in programming smooth flight mechanics in Unity; learned a lot about quaternions :)
- **[cymko:](https://cwru-ecse390.itch.io/cymko-f2024-team-2)** An action-platformer made in collaboration with students from Case Western and the Cleveland Institute of Art, where I designed and led the implementation of the reactive agent infrastructure underlying each of the game bosses. 
- **[language-interpreter:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/language-interpreter)** An interpreter for a very simple Java/C-reminiscent syntax, containing basic semantic actions such as assignment, math operations, conditionals, etc.
- **[sliding-tile-search-agent:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/first-ai-project)** This is my first hands-on experience in programming an intelligent agent, it's a simple bot written in Julia to solve the [8-puzzle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/8-puzzle-problem-using-branch-and-bound/) using Best-First and Local Beam search strategies.


## Contact

Email is my preferred method of contact (at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)**), however my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-anderson-ml/) is also a reliable way to make sure I see your correspondence.
