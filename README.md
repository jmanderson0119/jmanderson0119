# About Me

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Jacob Anderson (he/him) and this account is a collection of projects I have completed at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). 

## Background

I am currently a junior undergraduate and I plan to attend graduate school at Case following my 4-year undergraduate program. My academic interests include Artifical Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, Network Science, and Probability. Some of my in-major coursework I have taken include: Data Structures, Algorithm Design, Operating Systems, Discrete Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering.

## Repositories

I am always available to contact at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)** regarding new projects to collaborate on! Here is some of what's currently available to take a look at on my account:
