# About Me

Hello World! Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Jacob Anderson (he/him) and this account stores every project I will take on while attending [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). 

## Background

I am currently a rising junior and I plan to attend graduate school at Case following my 4-year undergraduate program. My academic interests include Artifical Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Probability. Some of my favorite courses I have taken include:

- Data Structures
- Algorithm Design
- Operating Systems
- Discrete Mathematics
- Linear Algebra

This fall I am looking forward to studying Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Intro to Artifical Intelligence, and Software Engineering!

## Repositories

I am currently making frequent contributions to this game design project I cooked up last spring that I wanted to see come to life, [here](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/atlas-cosmic-courier). However, I am always available to contact at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)** regarding new projects to contribute to! Here is what's currently available to take a look at on my account:

- **[atlas-cosmic-courier:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/atlas-cosmic-courier)** A space flight/combat videogame made with Unity 2021.3.18f1!
- **[game-design-group-project:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/game-design-group-project)** This stores my final group project for CSDS 290, an introduction to game design course at CWRU.
- **[csds391-textbook:](https://github.com/jmanderson0119/csds391-textbook)** Currently, this repository just stores some useful resources for studying AI, however I am going to slowly transform this repository into a bank of useful references for undergraduate CS students.

## Contact

Email is my preferred method of communication (at **[jma195@case.edu](mailto:jma195@case.edu)**), however here are some others way to get in touch with me:
